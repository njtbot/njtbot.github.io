After a couple of iterations of wordpress on a low-end VPS, I finally saw the light and made the switch to Github Pages. 

This blog is running on Jekyll, fonts by Google's Fonts API and the site design is crudely adapted from a cross between a Github Pages template and a previous site design I was toying with, although I've had to chop away a lot of cool php to get this to run on gh-pages.
